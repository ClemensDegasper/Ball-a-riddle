# Ball-a-riddle

This was my final project of the <a href="http://www.it-kolleg-imst.at/">IT Kolleg</a>.
My first programming project from 2009-2010. Was writte in c++ with the <a href="http://darkgdk.com/">Microsoft Dark GDK</a> engine.
I also implemented a way to control the ball with a Wii Mote, using GlovePie.
Glovepie is a program by Carl Kenner that allows you to write codes that link the Wiimote into your PC.
The GlovePie homepage is no longer available.

In the .rar file is everything need to start the game, if you have at least direct X 9 installed.
